[Plex](https://plex.tv) is a great media center solution, I use it a lot to watch films and tv shows. Plex Pass users can access streaming additional content, but I wanted to have this extra content locally on disk.

Using Plextras I can download trailer, interviews and behind the scenes videos. I have developed this simple script using python, it works on Linux and OS X and to use the script you need to get a [YouTube API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application) and place it into the code. You can also customize the youtube searches on the 5 last lines of code.

__Usage:__ python plextras.py [film name] [file / folder path]

__Dependencies:__

- sudo pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
- sudo pip install --upgrade youtube-dl
